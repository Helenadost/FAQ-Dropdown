            What is JavaScript?
        </button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of
                the
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
                for
                webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated
                JavaScript
                engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

                languages
                such as JavaScript.</p>
